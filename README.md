# Compare-SHA-Hashes

A simple batch program that I created for Windows 10 that will check SHA256 or SHA512 hashes.
I created this because I'm learning Security Fundamentals in college and wanted an easy way to test a file's integrity.

Instructions: 
1. Download the .bat file
2. Drag a file into it
3. Follow the prompts
